# üß† Object Detection in React + TensorFlow.js (YOLOv7)

A browser-based object detection project built with **React (Vite)**, **TensorFlow.js**, and **Tailwind CSS**.  
This app runs inference directly on the frontend using a YOLOv7 model converted to TensorFlow.js format‚Äîno backend required.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) (with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/))
- [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- TypeScript
- HTML5 Canvas

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-yolov7-tfjs.git
cd react-yolov7-tfjs
```

### 2. Install dependencies

You can use either **npm** or **yarn**:

```bash
# With npm
npm install

# With yarn
yarn install
```

### 3. Run the development server

```bash
# With npm
npm run dev

# With yarn
yarn dev
```

Then, open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

## üìÅ Model Placement

Place your TensorFlow.js model files in the following directory:

```
public/tfjs_model/
```

Expected files:

- `model.json`
- `*.bin` (binary weight files)

## üîÑ Convert YOLOv7 to TensorFlow.js

This project uses a YOLOv7 model converted from PyTorch to TensorFlow.js via ONNX.  
Here‚Äôs the full conversion pipeline:

### 1. PyTorch ‚Üí ONNX

## ‚ö†Ô∏è About the License

This project uses the [YOLOv7](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7) implementation by **WongKinYiu**, which provides strong performance and a more flexible license than later versions (e.g. YOLOv8 by Ultralytics, which uses AGPLv3).

AGPLv3 may restrict commercial use, as it requires full source code disclosure for any publicly accessible app.
